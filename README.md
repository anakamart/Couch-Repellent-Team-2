# Final Project: Couch Repellent

* Authors: Amber Liang, Anaka Mart, Kyla Vinson

## Overview
CouchRepellent is a basic gym check in and check out app. The app allows users to check in and out of a gym and log workouts. There is also a history section available so that users can look at their past workouts and track progress.

## Reflection
This project overall was fairly simple. The biggest issues the team had were getting the save functionality to work so that workout information would be saved. We also accidentally duplicated each others code because we were individually referencing our design document and accidentally worked on the same functionality without realizing it. 

## Compiling and Using
To use this app simply download it from the Google Play or iOS App Store.
